Small venues in the UK

Small venues that do or could host singer/songwriter types (protest, indie, folk...), storytellers, poets &c.

The sort of venue that might be a goer for: a) storyteller solo shows and troupes, b) Troubadour Club (singer + spoken act double header).

Imagines(1): Troubadour Club nights, (narrative song, protest song etc) singer + storyteller (or punk poet etc) double headers; shut the f*ck up and listen (sit down?) audience; (live music) pub, arts club, small music venue venues.

Imagines (2): being able to find venues for independent storytellers wanting to go on a trek or a tour, (ideally) on a cost recovery basis (at least), or come up with a funded scheme that generates a good return in terms of outcomes (at least) for a funding bid.

Wonders: are there storytellers out there developing a "home venue" with at least a viable audience (15-20) that could host visiting tellers and who have enough goodwill in their audience that they'd take a punt on a visiting teller if their home teller vouched for them? (Ideally, a circle of trust in a community of independent stroytellers; else pragmatically, a *quid pro quo* relationship...).
