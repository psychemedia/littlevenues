## Greg Chapman


Greg Chapman’s Discovery of Witchcraft
A show of Magic, Storytelling, History, Comedy and Thought.
In 1584, Reginald Scott released his book 'The Discoverie of Witchcraft'.
The book aimed to expose the truth behind what was believed to be ‘witchcraft’ at the time, including a section detailing the methods used by magicians to create their effects.
He hoped this book would put an end to innocent people being tried, imprisoned, and hanged for Witchcraft.
It would not.
Greg Chapman's new show combines magic, storytelling, history, comedy and more to talk about Witchtrials from the 15th Century through to the 20th Century, and does so in a way that is entertaining, informative, and thought-provoking!

## The Non-Psychic Seance

Get ready for an evening that combines the spooky with the funny, as 'The Non-Psychic 'Psychic'', magician Greg Chapman, takes his new performance on tour in Autumn 2025.

Inspired by the response to his 'The Non-Psychic 'Psychic' Show, and his book 'A Study in Psychic', Greg wanted to create a more intimate performance to bring the strangeness and excitement of a late Victorian-style fraudulent psychic seance with no pretence of actual psychic powers, and more discussion of some of the characters who used magical methods to fool people around the turn of the last century.
Due to the intimate nature of this 75-minute show, there is a strict maximum of 40 tickets available for any performance, and we recommend a minimum age of 12.
